## üìã Key Features

* **Intelligent Content Structuring:** Uses your choice of LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) to analyze text and intelligently structure it into slides with titles and bullet points.
* **Dynamic Template Styling:** Automatically inherits the complete look and feel‚Äîincluding fonts, colors, backgrounds, and logos‚Äîfrom any uploaded `.pptx` or `.potx` file by leveraging its Slide Master.
* **User-Provided API Keys:** Ensures privacy and control by allowing users to provide their own LLM API keys, which are never stored or logged.
* **Simple Web Interface:** A clean, easy-to-use interface for pasting text, uploading a template, and downloading the final presentation.
* **Flexible and Adaptable:** Works with a wide variety of templates, from simple designs to complex corporate branding.

## üß† How It Works

This application transforms unstructured text into a styled presentation through a sophisticated two-step process: intelligent content structuring by a Large Language Model (LLM) and precise style application using a backend engine.

### 1. Text Parsing and Slide Mapping

First, the user's raw text input and one-line guidance are sent to the selected LLM (Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic). The core of the prompt instructs the model to act as a presentation expert, analyzing the entire text to identify key themes, titles, and hierarchical points. It is specifically asked to return a structured JSON object, typically an array of slides, where each slide has a `title` and a `content` field (often an array of bullet points). The user's guidance heavily influences this process; for example, a request for an "investor pitch" will result in a more concise, impactful structure compared to a "technical summary." This ensures the slide breakdown is not arbitrary but contextually relevant to the user's goal.

### 2. Template Style and Asset Application

Once the structured JSON is received, the backend engine, powered by the `python-pptx` library, takes over. The user's uploaded template file (`.pptx` or `.potx`) is opened and analyzed. The engine inspects the template's **Slide Master** and its various **Slide Layouts** (e.g., 'Title Slide', 'Title and Content', 'Section Header'). It then intelligently iterates through the JSON data from the LLM, matching each slide's content to the most appropriate layout. For instance, a slide with a title and a list of bullet points is mapped to the 'Title and Content' layout. By doing this, the new presentation automatically inherits all the design elements from the template: fonts, color schemes, logos, backgrounds, and even placeholder image positions, ensuring the final output perfectly matches the user's desired style.
